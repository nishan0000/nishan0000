ğŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Nishan!

ğŸ”­ I'm a Data Scientist by profession, but not your typical one. I've carved my own path in the field, proving that you don't need a computer science background to make a significant impact.

ğŸ’¡ I'm deeply passionate about Generative AI and have a keen interest in cutting-edge technologies like Retrieval Augmented Generation, Langchain, LLAma Index, and Generative Language Models (LLM).

ğŸš€ I love exploring the endless possibilities of LLMs and have a knack for building innovative LLM-based applications.

ğŸŒ± I'm constantly learning and growing, driven by my enthusiasm for Generative AI. I believe in the power of AI to transform our world, and I'm excited to be part of that journey.

ğŸ‘¥ I'm looking to collaborate with other enthusiasts and experts in the field. If you're interested in Generative AI, I'd love to connect!

ğŸ“« Reach out to me if you want to talk about Data Science, Generative AI, or just want to say hi!

ğŸ’¼ Check out my repositories to see my work in action. I'm proud of what I've achieved so far, and I'm excited about what's to come!

ğŸŒŸ Remember, it's not about where you come from, it's about where you're going. Here's to the future of AI!
